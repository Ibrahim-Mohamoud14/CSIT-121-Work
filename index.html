<h3> Reflection from Lab02</h3>
<p> In lab02, It took a while for me to understand the whole HTML thing and how its structured. My understanding of HTML Web development is still under progress. I will continue to learn more about web development and how github works.

<h3> Reflection for lab 03</h3>
<p> Since Lab02, I've been learning how to use external CSS Stylesheets to keep the HTML clear and organized. I understand how ID's work and how to link CSS to HTML. I also know better how to use Github and the website publishing. I'm looking forward to knowing more.
